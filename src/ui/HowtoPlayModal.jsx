          Place the game board between you and your opponent. The board consists
          of two rows of six small pits (also called houses) and two larger pits
          (called stores) on each end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Put four seeds in each of the 12 small pits (for a total of 48 seeds).
          Each player controls the six houses closest to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The player who goes first is usually determined by mutual agreement or
          a coin toss.
